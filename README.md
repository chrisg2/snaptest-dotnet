# snaptest-dotnet

This is snaptest-dotnet, a tool to enable effective snapshot testing with .NET Core and .NET Framework.

This library has been inspired by:
- [Jest snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)
- [Snapshooter](https://github.com/SwissLife-OSS/snapshooter)
- [Snapper](https://theramis.github.io/Snapper/)

Treat this as experimental status. This means (amongst other things) that the interfaces and classes exposed from the SnapTest namespace are subject to change. If you are interested in using this library and the potential for changes is problematic for you then get in touch and we can discuss.

# Things to be done

1. Add unit tests for FileStorageReadingMiddleware, SnapshotBuilder

1. Add filtering middleware

1. Add XML comments for all public interfaces

1. Put strings into resx files

1. Look at other projects to check for other interesting capabilities/ideas
